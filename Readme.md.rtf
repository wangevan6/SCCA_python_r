\f0\fs24 \cf0 The processing for developing a software packages for user to smoothly use the SCCA L0 penalized method requires a careful development, robust testing as well as a clear usage guidance. \
\
To operationalize the software packages development process, Here is a breakdown of small steps\'94\
\
1. Develop  simulation models for SCCA method in R code to reproduce the simulation graph to the original paper.\
\
2. Sure the Python\'92s Version of SCCA method outcome in align with its r code counterparts. Quantitatively analysis the efficiency improvement interns of computation time. \
\
3. Repeat a similar process for the SDAR method to successfully integrate the method in to python.\
\
4. Adjust SCCA method with an expanded feature of using L0 penalized method to replace the normal L2 penalized method. Test the new SCCA method , and evaluate its performance in terms of approximation accuracy, computation time.\
\
5. Encapsulate the software, and open source  it as as python library to Github space.}
