The processing for developing a software packages for user to smoothly use the SCCA L0 penalized method requires a careful development, robust testing as well as a clear usage guidance. 

To operationalize the software packages development process, Here is a breakdown of small steps”

1. Develop  simulation models for SCCA method in R code to reproduce the simulation graph to the original paper.

2. Sure the Python’s Version of SCCA method outcome in align with its r code counterparts. Quantitatively analysis the efficiency improvement interns of computation time. 

3. Repeat a similar process for the SDAR method to successfully integrate the method in to python.

4. Adjust SCCA method with an expanded feature of using L0 penalized method to replace the normal L2 penalized method. Test the new SCCA method , and evaluate its performance in terms of approximation accuracy, computation time.

5. Encapsulate the software, and open source  it as as python library to Github space.
